Fix the following issues. The issues can be from different files or can overlap on same lines in one file.

In @app/components/sections/procedures/ProcedureFAQ.tsx around lines 32 - 34, The FAQ list is using index as the key in the faqs.map -> AccordionItem (key={index}), which can break when items are added/removed/reordered; update the FAQ type/interface to include a stable unique identifier (e.g., id: string) and change the mapping to use faq.id as the AccordionItem key (or fallback to index only if id is absent), updating any data construction sites to populate the id when possible so keys remain stable.

In @app/components/sections/contact/ContactInfo.tsx around lines 19 - 20, The tel: href uses raw info.phone which may contain spaces, dashes or parentheses; before building the contact array in ContactInfo.tsx, derive a sanitized phone string (preserving a leading '+' if present, but stripping all other non-digit characters) and use that sanitized value in the href (e.g., use href={`tel:${sanitizedPhone}`} while keeping value: info.phone for display); update the entry that currently uses href: `tel:${info.phone}` to reference the sanitized variable.

In @app/components/sections/contact/MapEmbed.tsx around lines 37 - 51, The iframe's hardcoded title in MapEmbed.tsx causes i18n inconsistency; change the component to accept a localizable title (e.g., prop name mapTitle or use the existing i18n hook used for loadingLabel/openInMapsLabel) and replace the literal "WistaClinic Location - Kagithane, Istanbul" with that value, providing a sensible default fallback for backward compatibility; update any parent usages to pass the localized string (or ensure the component calls the translation function) and keep the existing attributes like onLoad/setIsLoaded, className, and cn unchanged.

In @app/components/layout/ThemeToggle.tsx around lines 24 - 38, Add a subtle icon-swap animation using Framer Motion: import AnimatePresence and motion from 'framer-motion' in ThemeToggle.tsx and wrap the conditional Sun/Moon icons in an AnimatePresence with a motion.span keyed by resolvedTheme (or the icon) to animate exit/enter (e.g., opacity/scale) when setTheme toggles; keep the Button, onClick handler, aria-label, and CSS classes unchanged so only the icon markup is animated.

In @app/components/sections/contact/ContactForm.tsx around lines 237 - 259, The procedure Select (Controller name="procedure") doesn't render validation errors; update its render callback to accept fieldState (render={({ field, fieldState }) => ...}) and show the error message (fieldState.error?.message or control.formState.errors.procedure?.message) below the Select (e.g., under SelectTrigger/SelectContent) using the same error display style used by other fields so server-side validation mapped to "procedure" is visible.

In @app/components/sections/contact/ContactForm.tsx around lines 282 - 289, The submit button currently hardcodes "Sending..." when status === 'submitting', breaking i18n; update the FormLabels interface to include a new submitting (or submittingLabel) field and replace the hardcoded string in ContactForm (the conditional rendering that checks status === 'submitting') to use labels.submitting (or labels.submittingLabel) instead of "Sending..."; ensure callers that construct labels pass the new property or provide a default so builds/tests don't break.

In @app/components/sections/contact/ContactForm.tsx around lines 45 - 52, The Zod schema contactFormSchema currently uses hardcoded English messages; update the component to accept translated messages (for example via a prop named errorMessages or locale/labels.errors) and build contactFormSchema inside the component using those messages (e.g., use labels.errors?.nameMin ?? default) or alternatively configure a Zod errorMap for localization and pass it to Zod parsing; ensure fields referenced (name, email, phone, message, honeypot) use the provided translated strings instead of fixed English text so validation messages are localized.

In @app/components/layout/Footer.tsx around lines 14 - 22, The navItems array uses fallbacks only for dict.nav.gallery and dict.nav.testimonials causing inconsistent behavior; update navItems to either remove the two fallbacks or (preferred) add explicit fallback strings for every entry (home, about, procedures, doctors, gallery, testimonials, contact) by referencing the navItems constant and the dict.nav keys so each item uses something like dict.nav.<key> || '<FallbackLabel>' (use locale to build hrefs as currently done) to ensure uniform behavior when dictionary keys are missing.

In @app/[locale]/testimonials/page.tsx around lines 19 - 26, Validate the incoming locale in TestimonialsPage before calling getDictionary: use isValidLocale(params.locale) (or the same locale extraction pattern used elsewhere) and call notFound() when it returns false, then proceed to await getDictionary(locale as Locale) only for a valid locale; ensure the page also returns/uses the same metadata pattern as other locale-aware pages if applicable.

In @app/[locale]/procedures/[slug]/page.tsx around lines 45 - 46, The current assignment to detail uses the cast only on the fallback literal ({}), so ensure the type applies to the whole expression by casting the result of (dict?.procedures?.detail ?? {}) to Record<string,string> or, better, declare a proper type for the dictionary and annotate the detail variable with that type; target the symbols dict, procedures, and detail (and the variable detail) and either change the expression to cast the entire result to Record<string,string> or define an interface/type for the dictionary structure and use that type on detail.

In @app/[locale]/procedures/[slug]/page.tsx around lines 68 - 73, The ProcedureCTA is being passed empty-string fallbacks (detail.ctaTitle, detail.ctaDescription, detail.ctaButton) which can render a blank CTA; update the render in page.tsx to provide meaningful fallbacks (e.g., static or localized defaults) instead of '' — for example, replace title={detail.ctaTitle ?? ''} / description={detail.ctaDescription ?? ''} / buttonText={detail.ctaButton ?? ''} with title={detail.ctaTitle ?? fallbackTitle} / description={detail.ctaDescription ?? fallbackDescription} / buttonText={detail.ctaButton ?? fallbackButton} where fallbackTitle/fallbackDescription/fallbackButton are defined (or pulled from a locale dictionary) to ensure the CTA always shows useful text.

In @app/components/shared/GsapProvider.tsx around lines 31 - 35, The empty catch in the save function silently swallows sessionStorage errors; update the catch block in save (which calls sessionStorage.setItem with SCROLL_KEY and String(window.scrollY)) to include a brief inline comment such as "// ignore: quota or private mode" to document the intent and why the exception is safe to ignore.

In @app/components/sections/home/PatientJourney.tsx around lines 377 - 378, The inline magic value paddingTop: '80px' in PatientJourney should be replaced with a shared navbar height constant or CSS variable so both the navbar and PatientJourney stay in sync; create a constant (e.g., NAVBAR_HEIGHT) or a CSS variable (--navbar-height) used by the Navbar component (the element using "lg:h-20") and import/reference that same symbol from PatientJourney.tsx instead of the hardcoded '80px', updating the paddingTop usage to read from the shared value.

In @app/components/sections/home/GlassLayersHero.tsx around lines 7 - 10, The props type GlassLayersHeroProps uses dict: any which removes type safety; define a proper interface (e.g., GlassLayersDict) listing the expected keys used in this component (the keys referenced where multiple type assertions are applied) and replace dict: any with dict: GlassLayersDict in GlassLayersHeroProps; update the component and any usages (including the places currently using type assertions) to rely on the new interface so you can remove the unsafe casts and get compile-time checking for those dict properties.

In @app/components/sections/home/GlassLayersHero.tsx around lines 745 - 758, The default headline string contains a literal "\n" which won't produce a line break in the rendered <h2>; update the GlassLayersHero <h2> rendering so heroDict.ctaHeadline displays as multiple lines—either apply CSS like whiteSpace: 'pre-line' in the existing style object of the <h2> or transform the string into JSX with an explicit line break (e.g., split on '\n' and join with <br />) when using heroDict.ctaHeadline in the <h2> so the intended two-line headline appears.

In @app/components/sections/home/ServicesGrid.tsx at line 743, In ServicesGrid.tsx remove the unnecessary type assertion on the style property by changing the style entry that reads textTransform: 'uppercase' as const to simply textTransform: 'uppercase'; update the style object where this appears (look for the textTransform key inside the ServicesGrid component) and ensure no other code relies on the asserted literal type.

In @app/components/sections/home/ServicesGrid.tsx around lines 41 - 67, The kickers and accentPaths maps (kickers, accentPaths) are hardcoded and can fall out of sync with the procedures data used by ServicesGrid; update the implementation to either co-locate these fields with each procedure (add kicker and accentPath properties to the procedures dataset and read them in ServicesGrid) or add a runtime validation in development that iterates procedures and reports any slugs missing from kickers/accentPaths (use the procedures array and the kickers/accentPaths maps to produce a console.warn or throw in dev only), ensuring any missing mapping is logged so slugs remain covered.

In @app/components/sections/home/ServicesGrid.tsx around lines 99 - 127, The animation loop runs continuously even when no item is hovered; update the effect (the useEffect that currently references isMobile and sets up handleMouseMove, animate and rafRef) to start the RAF loop and add the mousemove listener only when hoveredSlug is non-null (and isMobile === false), and cancelAnimationFrame + remove the listener immediately when hoveredSlug becomes null; adjust the effect dependencies to include hoveredSlug so animate/rafRef/floatingImgRef/imgPos/mousePos are only active during hover, ensuring cleanup in the return callback to cancel rafRef.current and remove the event listener.
