Fix the following issues. The issues can be from different files or can overlap on same lines in one file.

In @app/components/shared/GsapProvider.tsx around lines 88 - 93, The catch block in GsapProvider currently only logs in development and silences errors in production; update the .catch((error) => { ... }) handler in the GsapProvider component to report failures to the app's error tracking or telemetry (e.g., call a centralized logger like trackError/monitoring.report or Sentry.captureException) while still keeping the dev console.warn; ensure you pass the error object plus context ("Failed to load GSAP") and keep existing state handling (checking cancelled and calling setGsapReady(false)).

In @app/components/sections/home/ServicesGrid.tsx around lines 402 - 468, Extract the inline IIFE into precomputed variables to improve readability: before the component's return compute const activeIndex = procedures.findIndex(p => p.slug === hoveredSlug) and const activeProcedure = activeIndex !== -1 ? procedures[activeIndex] : null, then replace the IIFE with a conditional render that returns null if !activeProcedure and otherwise uses activeProcedure (proc), pathD (accentPaths[proc.slug] || ''), the watermark index (activeIndex + 1), and kickers[proc.slug] to render the same JSX; optionally factor that JSX into a small subcomponent (e.g., FloatingProcedureCard) to keep the parent render concise.
